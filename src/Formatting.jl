        DEPRECATION NOTICE

        Formatting.jl has been unmaintained for a while, with some serious
        correctness bugs compromising the original purpose of the package. As a result,
        it has been deprecated - consider using an alternative, such as
        `Format.jl` (https://github.com/JuliaString/Format.jl) or the `Printf` stdlib directly.

        If your are not using Formatting.jl as a direct dependency, please consider
        opening an issue on any packages your are using that do use it as a dependency.
        From Julia 1.9 onwards, you can query `]why Formatting` to figure out which
        package originally brings it in as a dependency.
